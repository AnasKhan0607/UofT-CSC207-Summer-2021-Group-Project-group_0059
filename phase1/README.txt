+About our program 

Our program is a game editor specially made for the creation of visual novel games. Categorized by theme: there are 3 branches- User, Game, and Template. Where User is mostly about login and signup. And Game is everything associated with Game Play, Game Creation/Edition. Last but not least, the Template which is about template that is used to create a Game, and here we allows admin users to edit templates. And we actually divided the job this way, into: User Branch, Game Branch, and Template Branch.

+Instruction on running
Run main.java and we will have the interface of Login. There we can choose to login with an account in record, signup one, or login temporarily as a guest.
After logged in successfully, we’ll have a navigator and by inputting the integer, we’ll be redirected to corresponding GUI.(Attention: once logout is chosen, the program ends. And to login/signup again, we will have to run Main.java again)

In the game GUI, there are 5 options. You can create a game, play a game that you created, edit a game that is created by you and also private, view games that are public, or private games created by you, and at last you can choose to exit the game GUI.

In the Template editing Interface you follow the instructions on the screen and you should be able to edit existing template's
attributes.
